## IMDb Power BI Visualization Challenge

**Task Description**

In this challenge, you will use your knowledge of the IMDb dataset and apply it to create an engaging and informative Power BI report. IMDb is an online database of movies, television shows, and video games, and you already have experience working with its dataset in SQL.

**Objective**

Your objective is to use Power BI to build a comprehensive and visually appealing report that highlights interesting insights from the IMDb dataset. This challenge will test your data visualization and storytelling skills.

**Dataset**

You will use the same IMDb dataset that you previously worked with during the SQL part of the course.

**Task Requirements:**

1. Data Import:
   - Import the IMDb dataset into Power BI. (you can use views you already created)

2. Data Transformation:
   - Perform any necessary data cleaning and transformation to prepare the data for visualization.

3. Visualizations:
   - Create a variety of interactive and insightful visualizations using Power BI's chart types (bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, etc.). Consider the following ideas:
     - Top-rated movies/shows by genre.
     - Distribution of IMDb ratings.
     - Trend of average IMDb ratings over the actor.
     - Comparison of average rating for actors for different genres.

4. Custom Calculations:
   - Add calculated columns or measures to enrich your report's analysis. For instance, you can calculate the average IMDb rating for each director or actor.

5. Report Layout and Design:
   - Design the layout of your report to be visually appealing and easy to navigate. Organize the visualizations logically and use appropriate colors and fonts.

6. Interactivity:
   - Implement slicers, filters, and drill-through options to enable users to interact with the data and explore insights on their own.

7. Data Storytelling:
   - Craft a compelling data story by explaining the patterns and trends you've identified. Use your visualizations to support your narrative.

**Submission Guidelines:**

- Save your Power BI report file as `<user>_sql_day5.pbix` and ensure that it includes all the visuals and interactive elements.
- Prepare a brief written summary (in PDF or .md format) describing the objective of your report, the key insights, and any challenges faced during the process.
